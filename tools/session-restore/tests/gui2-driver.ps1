# THE SHIPPED WINDOW (lib\sessions-gui2.ps1), built and never shown.
#
# 🔴 THIS IS THE ONLY SUITE THAT TESTS WHAT ACTUALLY OPENS. headless, inbox and
# keys drive lib\sessions-gui.ps1, the RETIRED window, and their green says
# nothing about the app. Every assertion here was written against a real defect
# found while building the thing it covers - none of them are decorative.
#
# It runs against the OPERATOR'S OWN REGISTRY rather than a fixture, because the
# defects it caught were all shaped by real data: 218 conversations, 27 projects
# whose leaf names collide, worktrees named after the conversation inside them.
# Anything it changes, it changes back, and it never saves.
#
# 🔴 IT NEVER LAUNCHES, KILLS OR TYPES INTO ANYTHING. Every destructive path is
# checked by asking what it WOULD do. The one place that genuinely starts a
# session is the app suite's own probe, not here.
